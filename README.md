# 42-graduation-verification
A program that automatically verifies and displays to what extent a 42 network student validates the requirements for [the bachelor and master](https://meta.intra.42.fr/articles/19-requirements).

## Use
Simply `make` and follow the instructions.

## Compatibility
Compatible with **macOS**. When using macOS it expects **brew** to be available for use in 'sripts/setup.sh'.

Could also be compatible with **Linux** and **Windows** as I adapted the code for those. However I was never able to test it on those OSs.

## Notes
In 'notes' directory one can find more information about how much xp per hour projects give and as such what projects give the most xp. Also projects indicated as potential requirements that I did not found in 19's cursus.

## Warnings
Changes in requirements could happen in the future.
